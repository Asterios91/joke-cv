        <p>This is another paragraph. It speaks of things that I have done, maybe. I have definitely done things, yes.
            I'll just write some more to fill the space. This is more writing about meaningful things about my life.
            Ah, good times. Or maybe bad times, I am not sure. Let's fill up some more text.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum">Lorem ipsum</a> and stuff. Ovidius
            poeta in terra pontica exulat. Well, I seem to have run out of text now. Paragraph over.

        <h3>Education?</h3>
        <p>I have most definitely had an education. How dare you, sir or madam, imply the opposite. A shame upon your
            family. My education is of the highest caliber. That's why I use fancy words such as verbose and obsequious.
            I have been in schools and universities. Yes, plural. Multiple universities. One was not enough for a person
            as obsequious as I. I shall fill some more text here with more Latin. Gluteus maximus.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>This is one education I have done.</li>
            <li>This is another. Man, so much education.</li>
            <li>This is where I considered I may have done a bit too much education.</li>
            <li>This is when I reconsidered and did some more. Oopsie.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here is a list of my hobbies, of which I have many and varied. A veritable renaissance man indeed.</p>

            <li>World of Warcraft.</li>
            <li>Uhm... Other video games.</li>
            <li>This was a mistake.</li>
            <li>World of Warcraft.</li>
